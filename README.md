# AI-Rep-Counter
A Python application that uses SVM and a webcam feed to count the number of reps of an exercise.

Steps for smooth running:
1. Download all the files and install the libraries- Pillow, sklearn, and cv2.
2. Run the main.py file.
3. A Tkinter GUI window showing the webcam feed and controls will open.
4. Now, keep one arm in an extended curl position and click on the extended a few times.
5. Next, keep your arm contracted with the weights and click on the contracted button a few times.
6. After completing the above steps click on the train model button.
7. You will receive a model is trained message, now your rep counter is ready to track some of those gains.
